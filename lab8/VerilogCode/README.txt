Lab works as it is supposed to and should cover all the demo points.

Before testing, please compile the Quartus code and program it to the FPGA board. 
Then, press the RESET button on the FPGA Board (KEY0). Afterwards, open eclipse
and run the C program. 

This is because we programmed the ball to be stationary when the program starts
which we represent as it being reset.
